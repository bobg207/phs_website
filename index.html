        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>It is my belief that every student can be successful in math through hard work and perseverance.
            Being successful includes taking daily notes, paying attention in class, getting extra help outside
            of class when necessary, and not being afraid to make mistakes. </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>"To avoid situations in which you might make mistakes may be the biggest mistake of all."</em>
            <strong>--Peter McWilliams</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Please remember that I am here to help you achieve your desired level of success.   You are welcome
            to come in for help outside of class, provided you make arrangements with me ahead of time.
            I’m available Blue Block 3 and White Block 4.  Please see me if you need any help.</p>
